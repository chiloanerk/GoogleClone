# GoogleClone
Hi there, Here I created a Google clone by just looking at it, i did not use any tutorials or anything. Only references on how to manipulate elements from W3Schools.
Feel Free to check out my code and try to improve on it
#1 known issues, I can't get the hover background border to be round on the top nav icons.


This one is for the guys at UNISA hoping to give some inspiration, one of the things i wish i did was practice in my first year but 
all is well, i passed in the end but i encourage you all to study hard whenever you have free time.

I have created a group on telegram, I am hoping it will be a bootcamp style where we give each other challenges and advice on web development!
