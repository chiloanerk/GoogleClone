# GoogleClone
Site is hosted here https://chiloanerk.github.io/GoogleClone/

Hi there, Here I created a Google clone by just looking at it, i did not use any tutorials or anything. 
Only referenced how to manipulate elements from W3Schools and other sources online.
Feel Free to check out my code and try to improve on it, this took me around 2 hours if i dont count interruptions to work on.
#1 known issues, I can't get the hover background border to be round on the top nav icons.


This one is for the guys at UNISA hoping to give some inspiration, one of the things i wish i did was practice in my first year but 
all is well, i passed in the end but i encourage you all to study hard whenever you have free time.

I have created a group on telegram, I am hoping it will be a bootcamp style where we give each other challenges and advice on web development!
